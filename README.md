## About Me
- 21 years old
- B.A in Mathematics, graduated in 2025 from *UKEN Krakow*
- 4th-year Computer Science student at *AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow*
- Software Engineer Intern at *Software Mansion*.
  
Hi, my name is Filip and I do some programming & mathematical research. 

I am currently enrolled in 4th year *CS* studies and in June 2025 i graduated in Mathematics. This summer I am working as SE intern at *Software Mansion*.

In pure mathematics I am mostly interested in *Algebraic Geometry* (free conic arrangements, postulations of lines, geproci sets).

I am falling in love with computer algebra systems (**OSCAR**) and *Computational Algebra* in general. 

Recently, I've started some work around *Graph Isomorphism* problem. 

### My work
- *"On free arrangements of three conics"* - [[preprint] ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20025) - Joint work with ≈Åukasz Merta and Marcin Zieli≈Ñski.
- *"Postulation of lines in projecitve space of dimension three"* - [[pdf]](https://mlodyjesienin.github.io/my-papers/bachelor-thesis-levan-zielinski.pdf) -  My Bachelor Thesis in Mathematic written with Miko≈Çaj Le Van under prof. Tomasz Szemberg.
